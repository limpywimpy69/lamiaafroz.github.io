        <h2>About me</h2>
        <!-- <p>info about my bg, interest, experience and acheivements</p> -->
        <p>I am a third-year IT student at York University with a strong passion for Coding, Data Analytics, Cybersecurity, Database Management and Video Game Development.
            I enjoy learning new concepts and taking on projects that challenge my skills and creativity. I have always been super passionate about all things computer. It used 
            to be my best subject in high school and I would always be the go-to person for any tech-related issues. I love problem solving and finding efficient solutions, 
            which is i chose to pursue a career in IT. <br><br>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience in various programming languages including Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. 
            I have also worked on several projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, such as developing a 2D game in Java, creating 
            websites using HTML/CSS/JS, and working with raw data in Python to extract meaningful insights. 
             <br><br>
          
            I am really dedicated to my studies which has earned me a spot on the Dean's list of student scholars with a 3.8/4.00 GPA and have been granted numerous scholarships for student excellence.
