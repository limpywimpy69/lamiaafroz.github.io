                <h3>2D Java Game </h3>
                <p>	
                    My first major project was a 2D game developed in Java, where I applied core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, 
                    inheritance, and polymorphism. I was responsible for designing and implementing key gameplay mechanics, including player movement, enemy AI, collision detection, 
                    and basic game physics. In addition to programming, I created custom pixel art and frame-by-frame animations for characters, environments, and user interface elements.

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I have worked on multiple websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of them being this very website you are on right now! Another notable website I've worked on 
                    is a digital study/work environment as part of a group project. It features a timer, calendar, to-do list, notepad and ambient sounds/music to help users stay focused and productive. We first used 
                    Figma to desgin the layout and user interface of the website before moving on to the code. I was responsible for the desiging and coding the main page, login, calendar and notepad.
                    The user is greeted with the main page which is a laptop on a desk, whereas the desktop icons on the screen are the various features of the website. For example, clicking 
                    on the calendar "desktop icon" opens up the calendar feature, where you can view the current month and add events to specific dates. You can try out the website for yourself on my github page

                <h3>Technical Writing Repair guide</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of my technical writing course, I created a comprehensive step by step guide for replacing the thermal paste on a Lenovo Legion Y530-15ICH laptop. The guide included 
                    a clear introduction explaining overheating issues, a list of required tools/parts, and detailed intructions with photograpghs covering diassembly, cleaning, paste application,
                    and reassembly. Safety notes, screw sizes, and visual aids ensured accessibility for both beginners and experienced users, showcasing my ability to write clear, user-friendly 
                    technical documentation. You can view the full repair guide <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Lenovo+Legion+Y530-15ICH+Thermal+Paste+Replacement/169637" target="_blank">here</a>.
